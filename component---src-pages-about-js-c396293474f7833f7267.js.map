Iâ€™ve worked in a variety of different\n          technologies including C#, Angular, Python, Node, and my personal favorite, React.\n      </Typography><br />\n        <Typography align={'justify'}>\n          Being a remote engineer, I am continually trying to find new ways to stay connected in the community and\n        stay progressive with tech. I do this by staying active on my <a href=\"https://github.com/ChaseHardin\">GitHub</a>, contributing to this blog, and most\n        recently, Iâ€™ve started connecting with the open source world. My most recent contribution to NPM is <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-cards\">react-responsive-cards</a>.\n      </Typography>\n        <Typography variant={'h4'} style={headerFont}>\n          More About Me\n      </Typography>\n        <Typography align={'justify'}>\n          I grew up on a cattle farm which cultivated my love for the outdoors. My life consisted of hunting\n          whitetail deer, horse riding, and working cattle. I also had the opportunity to develop a passion\n          for music, which created a lot of unique opportunities for me. As a college student, I spent a year\n          touring the country with Lorie Line and the Fab Five. It was an amazing opportunity and I learned\n          so much. That same year, I learned about programming and decided to pursue Software Engineering as a career.\n      </Typography><br />\n        <Typography align={'justify'}>\n          In 2018, I married my gorgeous wife, Makenna. We live on an 8.5-acre acreage with chickens, two cats, and our\n          golden retrievers â€“ Ranger and Bambi. With the extra space, Iâ€™ve become a weekend woodworker and enjoy building\n          things. This past year, I've built tables, cutting boards, and a butcher block work bench. As a woodworker\n          and guitarist, I'd like to build my own guitar one day! ðŸŽ¸\n      </Typography><br />\n        <Typography variant={'h4'} style={headerFont}>\n          The Purpose of This Blog\n      </Typography>\n        <Typography align={'justify'}>\n          Iâ€™ve always enjoyed helping others learn new technologies and this blog is just one way for me to contribute back to\n          the developer community. On this blog, Iâ€™ll be sharing my ideas, how I write code, and how I overcame technical problems.\n          How I develop is just one of many ways to write code so please donâ€™t take these as absolutes. These posts are meant to make us\n          question our way of thinking and writing code.\n      </Typography>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
