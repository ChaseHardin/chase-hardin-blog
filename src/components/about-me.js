                I am a Software Engineer and I work fully remote from my home south of Des Moines, IA.
                I went to Simpson College where I graduated with a degree in Computer Information Systems,
                minor in Computer Science, and emphasis in Graphic Design. Iâ€™ve worked in a variety of different
                technologies including C#, Angular, Python, Node, and my personal favorite, React.

                Being a remote engineer, I am continually trying to find new ways to stay connected in the community and
                stay progressive with tech. I do this by staying active on my <a href="https://github.com/ChaseHardin">GitHub</a>, contributing to this blog, and most
                recently, Iâ€™ve started connecting with the open source world. My most recent contribution to NPM is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-cards">react-responsive-cards</a>.

                More About Me
            </Typography>

            <Typography align={'justify'}>
                I grew up on a cattle farm which cultivated my love for the outdoors. My life consisted of hunting
                whitetail deer, horse riding, and working cattle. I also had the opportunity to develop a passion
                for music, which created a lot of unique opportunities for me. As a college student, I spent a year
                touring the country with Lorie Line and the Fab Five. It was an amazing opportunity and I learned
                so much. That same year, I learned about programming and decided to pursue Software Engineering as a career.

                In 2018, I married my gorgeous wife, Makenna. We live on an 8.5-acre acreage with chickens, two cats, and our
                golden retrievers â€“ Ranger and Bambi. With the extra space, Iâ€™ve become a weekend woodworker and enjoy building
                things. This past year, I've built tables, cutting boards, and a butcher block work bench. As a woodworker
                and guitarist, I'd like to build my own guitar one day! ðŸŽ¸

                The Purpose of This Blog
            </Typography>

            <Typography align={'justify'}>
                Iâ€™ve always enjoyed helping others learn new technologies and this blog is just one way for me to contribute back to
                the developer community. On this blog, Iâ€™ll be sharing my ideas, how I write code, and how I overcame technical problems.
                How I develop is just one of many ways to write code so please donâ€™t take these as absolutes. These posts are meant to make us
                question our way of thinking and writing code.
